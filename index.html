								-->
								<p>Growing up, I have always had an interest in solving puzzles. This puzzling happens to be my favorite part of the field of data analytics. I enjoy pulling the story out of a data set, and when that story is presented and shared, it becomes meaningful. While pursuing my undergraduate degree, I knew that I enjoyed STEM, but I also made it a point to develop my skillset and connect with communities outside my own. My Hispanic Studies degree with my minor in Sustainability was the playing field to accomplish this blend of scientific communication with communities. </p>
								<br>	
								<p>After several years of research in marine biology, my experiences in the field and lab have taught me to be a detail-oriented, highly adaptable problem-solver and quick learner. Some of my research highlights include fieldwork in Southern California's rocky intertidal and Hawai'i's tropical intertidal zones studying the productivity of algae. I led and executed over 23 discrete experiments. I collected, cleaned, analyzed, and shared findings from large datasets through visualization softwares such as R and Microsoft Excel. These datasets and visualizations were further utilized for future academic papers, grants (the largest over $500,000), and presentations for scientific and community audiences. After these experiences, I envisioned myself obtaining a masters degree in this field. Though I am passionate about marine conservation, I quickly realized post-graduation that I wasn't ready to devote my life to the lifestyle of academic ecology, but I still hoped to apply my data-driven mindset to a career.</p>
								<br>
								<p>After a what would be a classic coming-of-age montage in an early-2000s film of me breaking into the reality of adulthood full of taxes, lease agreements, and a minimum wage job or two (there is nothing quite like deescalating upset customers in the service industry!), I was fortunate enough to join a lively undergraduate admission team at my alma mater. My current role as an undergraduate Admission Counselor is built on interpersonal communication. I facilitate presentations, campus tours, visits to high schools, college fairs, and events with upwards of 2,000 attendees. I prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion within the admissions process by working with underserved communities and engaging with high school programs focused on providing accessible higher education resources. Managing heavy workloads, I conduct holistic reviews of over 1,200 applications alongside other daily project duties (application reading season is no joke!). This position has developed both my ability to present information clearly and concisely to a variety of audiences and my ability to remain adaptable, efficient, and organized while proficiently managing multiple projects and deadlines. Outside of the more "customer service oriented" job responsibilities, working with data has remained at the forefront of my mindset. I have sought ways to incorporate data analytics and research into our planning for recruitment travel, admission event resources, and yield strategies. Some of my current projects include evaluating the effectiveness of student interviews on enrollment yield and evaluating the effectiveness of sendoff events on student melt. These projects require proficiency in the university's SQL-based records database and Peoplesoft CRM, adept communication of progress reports for supervisors and stakeholders, seamless collaboration with multiple university departments, and the ability to communicate the data and findings effectively to develop actionable management strategies.</p>
								<br>
								<p>In my free-time, I have worked tirelessly to obtain additional accredidations and certifications (see <a href="#education">"Education"</a>) in data analytics while completing case studies to showcase my understanding (see <a href="#projects"> "Projects"</a>), so I can eventually pivot to that field. While my young professional and educational background may be non-traditional, I have found those with a "linear" path are a select few. I am still young, but the twists and turns (and months of telling my parents I'm "figuring it out") are a testament to my versatility, and resiliency in diverse work environments. I have found that being adaptable to life's many puzzles is a surefire way to make my story matter. My innate curiosity, coupled with an ability to learn quickly, and desire to carry out every task to the best of my ability have been instrumental in navigating my unconventional path thus far, and I am confident it will continue to serve me well as I seek to step into a career in data analytics. My interest in data analytics goes beyond just technical skillsâ€”it's also about using data to tell compelling stories and drive positive change in whatever community I find myself in next.</p>
