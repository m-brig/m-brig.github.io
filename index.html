								-->
								<p>Growing up, I have always had an interest in solving puzzles and telling stories. Puzzling and storytelling happen to be my favorite parts of the field of data analytics. I enjoy pulling the story out of a data set, and when that story is presented and shared, it becomes meaningful. My path thus far has been far from linear, but, as we all know by now, direct trajectories are rare and it is unusual that your path turns out exactly the way you expect it to. </p>
								<br>
								<p>In my undergraduate years, I was particularly drawn to a degree in Hispanic Studies, and soon found myself invested in research about storytelling and the way in which stories are told. Meanwhile, to scratch my STEM "itch," I was heavily involved in undergraduate research in marine biology, thinking that eventually I wanted to pursue a masters degree in the field. Some of my research highlights include fieldwork in Southern California's rocky intertidal and Hawai'i's tropical intertidal zones studying the productivity of algae. I led and executed over 23 discrete experiments. I collected, cleaned, analyzed, and shared findings from large datasets through visualization softwares such as R and Microsoft Excel. These datasets and visualizations were further utilized for future academic papers, grants, and presentations for both scientific and community audiences. I loved being able to connect with communities to gather data and make an impact on their conservation and management strategies. Telling the story of their data, showing them what the data meant and what they could do with these new insights, was by far my favorite part. My Hispanic Studies degree with my minor in Sustainability and affinity for Marine Biology was the playing field to accomplish a satisfying blend of scientific communication with communities. Ultimately, I felt the reality of a masters in Marine Biology didn't quite align with my hopes, so I set off to explore a career in the storytelling aspects and data-driven thinking that I loved about the work.</p>
								<br>	
								<p>After a what would be a classic coming-of-age montage in an early-2000s film of me breaking into the reality of adulthood full of taxes, lease agreements, and a minimum wage job or two (there is nothing quite like deescalating upset customers in the service industry!), I was fortunate enough to join a lively undergraduate admission team at my alma mater. My current role as an undergraduate Admission Counselor is built on interpersonal communication. I facilitate presentations, campus tours, visits to high schools, college fairs, and events with upwards of 2,000 attendees. I prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion within the admissions process by working with underserved communities and engaging with high school programs focused on providing accessible higher education resources. Managing heavy workloads, I conduct holistic reviews of over 1,200 applications alongside other daily project duties (application reading season is no joke!). Storytelling with data consistently comes up in this role. Reading applications is, at its core, extracting the story of an applicant from the information they have chosen to share. This position has developed both my ability to present information clearly and concisely to a variety of audiences and my ability to remain adaptable, efficient, and organized while proficiently managing multiple projects and deadlines. Outside of the more "customer service oriented" job responsibilities, working with data has remained at the forefront of my mindset. I have sought ways to incorporate data analytics and research into our planning for recruitment travel, admission event resources, and yield strategies. Some of my current projects include evaluating the impact of student interviews on enrollment yield and evaluating the effectiveness of sendoff events on student melt. These projects require proficiency in the university's SQL-based records database and CRM (Slate and Peoplesoft), adept communication of progress reports for supervisors and stakeholders, seamless collaboration with multiple university departments (more challenging than anticipated!), and the ability to communicate the data and findings effectively to develop actionable management strategies.</p>
								<br>
								<p>In my free-time, I have worked tirelessly to obtain additional accredidations and certifications (see <a href="#education">"Education"</a>) in data analytics while completing case studies to showcase my understanding (see <a href="#projects"> "Projects"</a>), so I can eventually transition into a career more closely aligned with my diverse interests. I am still young, but the twists and turns (and months of telling my parents I'm "figuring it out") are a testament to my versatility and resiliency in diverse work environments. While my young professional and educational background may be non-traditional, I have found that being adaptable to life's many puzzles is a surefire way to make my story matter. My innate curiosity, coupled with an ability to learn quickly, and desire to carry out every task to the best of my ability have been instrumental in navigating my unconventional path thus far, and I am confident it will continue to serve me well as I seek to step into a career in data analytics. My interest in data analytics goes beyond just technical skillsâ€”it's also about using data to tell compelling stories and drive positive change in whatever community I find myself in next.</p>
